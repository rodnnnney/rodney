      <h1>Why I think Stablecoins are cool</h1>
      <p>~ 5 min read</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Following the 2008 financial crisis, the white paper for what would become
      known as Bitcoin was published. Ever since then, it has opened the flood
      gates to all different types of cryptocurrencies that are created to solve
      a niche, specific use case. One of these is stablecoins.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is a stablecoin? There are a few types of stablecoins but the most
      popular are Collateralized Stable coins. According to Coinbase, "They are
      type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as a
      fiat currency or gold, to maintain a stable price". For example, leading
      stablecoins pegged to the U.S dollar such as Tether (USDT) and USD
      Coin(USDC) hold very liquid traditional assets. These would include
      short-term government debt securities, treasury bills and cash.
      Essentially, for every USDT or USDC in circulation, it means that the
      issuers must maintain an equivalent amount in a mix of highly liquid and
      low risk assets(mentioned above).
    </p>

    <p>
      As of the latest report, in sept 2024, USDC is backed by a reserve
      primarily composed of two main components: short-dated U.S. Treasury
      securities and cash. The breakdown is approximately 80% in U.S. Treasuries
      and 20% in cash. To drive this point home, I want to compare to when the
      US was on the gold standard. The gold standard monetary system where the
      value of a country's currency is directly linked to a specified amount of
      gold.
    </p>

    <p>
      For every dollar in circulation (in real life), there was a equal amounts
      of gold in government vaults and central banks. It act as a means to limit
      inflation by restricting the amount of money that can be printed. However,
      the downside was that it limited the flexibility of monetary policy,
      especially during economic downturn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stablecoins are a modern embodiment of this monetary system where it
      solves both the issues of traditional crypto currencies and fiat
      currencies. A major concern with holding assets in cryptocurrencies is
      their high volatility, which is a valid issue. And the issue with
      traditional fiat currencies is that they are very centralized. Your
      dollars, for better or worse, are held in custody by a bank. Stablecoins
      provide the both of both worlds where they solve the volatility issue by
      pegging to real world assets (RWAs) and provide the decentralized nature
      by being on the block chain and allow self custody through smart wallets.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are reading this, I'm going to make the assumption you are in the
      West, where we have very strong financial institutions and infrastructure.
      With USD being the reserve currency of the world, and CAD being a rather
      strong currency. Paired with modern day tools like Venmo, Paypal,
      e-transfer. We take these things for granted. In countries where this is
      not the case, especially among Latin American countries such as Argentina,
      stablecoins are starting to make an impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, in Argentina where in 2023, the inflation was a WHOPPING
      133.49%. To put that into perspective, if you lived in the Argentina and
      held $100 Argentine Peso(ARS), you would end the year with around
      42.8$(ARS). You would need $233.49(ARS) to purchase the same amount of
      goods and services.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you thought about simply converting your ARS into USD, the Argentinian
      government has strict currency controls that limit the amount of U.S
      dollars individuals can legally purchase each month. There is also a
      significant difference between the official exchange rate and the (or
      "blue") market rate. People can access dollars on the blue market, but it
      is technically illegal and carries risks.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is compounded by the fact that the Argentine government has faced
      recurring dollar shortages due to high demand for USD and limited foreign
      currency reserves. Not to mention, if you thought about simply buying US
      stocks, that's also a tedious and complicated process. Argentinians have
      to open accounts with international brokers that provider access to U.S.
      However, opening these accounts may require compliance with international
      banking and regulatory requirements, including providing identification
      and proof of income.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to the strict currency controls previously mentioned, the legal limit
      of U.S dollars that can be legally purchased each month. Imagine the
      headache locals have to deal with to simply prevent their money's
      purchasing power to decrease more than 100% every year.
    </p>

    <p>
      This where stablecoins shine, anyone in Argentina with a phone can create
      an account on a trusted centralized exchange where it allows users to buy
      stablecoins in ARS. The user can either choose to keep it on a centralized
      exchange where it's custodied for you or download an app like Phantom
      Wallet or Metamask which allow self custody. Now you hold the world's
      reserve currency and you can do it under 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there are still barriers that Argentinians must overcome to use
      stablecoins. The main issue is that not all merchants accept USDT;
      therefore, the use of stablecoins is more common in tech-savvy or informal
      sectors. As well as the exchange rate from USDT to ARS can also be very
      volatile due to market conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are also workarounds to the issues mentioned above, peer-to-peer
      payments can be transferred directly between digital wallets seamlessly.
      This is commonly used for transactions such as paying for freelancers,
      splitting bills, or informal sales. Another medium that is rising in
      popularity are apps that allow you to find others wanting to swap USDT to
      ARS and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are turning to be real solutions because Argentina leads the world
      in Crypto Adoption. A Forbes report highlights that Argentinians are
      increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies as a hedge against their
      inflating local currency. The rate of crypto adoption in the country
      surpasses that of any other in the Western Hemisphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Forbes, analysis using SimilarWeb indicates that 2.5 million
      of the 130 million users on the top 55 crypto exchanges are from
      Argentina. Keep in mind that Argentina has a population of around 46
      million, while the global population is approximately 8 billion.
      Argentina's share of crypto adoption (1.92%) is about 3.34 times or 334%
      higher than its share of the world population (0.575%).
    </p>

    <p>
      Adoption of anything on a global scale will undoubtedly take time and
      incredible amounts of effort from the brightest of minds. However, it is
      undeniable that crypto is not only the future, but it is a bright future.
