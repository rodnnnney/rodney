    <p>
      Memecoins are fundamentally flawed. You might think I'm saying this
      because I've only lost money trading them and haven't achieved the
      promised generational wealth - that's a fair assumption, but there's more
      to it than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you take a step back and look at memes for what they are, you'll notice
      that they undermine the credibility of cryptocurrency as a whole. In this
      short essay, I'll explain my perspective on memecoins and why I believe
      they're detrimental to the crypto ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Bitcoin whitepaper was released in 2008, Satoshi envisioned
      Bitcoin as a solution to the double-spending problem, centralization
      issues, and as a means for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for
      central authorities.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Memes Hurt Crypto</h3>
    <p>
      I fundamentally dislike memecoins because they are zero-sum games. For
      someone to achieve a 10x return and "retire their parents," that profit
      must come from somewhere else (i.e., someone else's losses). This dynamic
      is inherently extractive and predatory. It's disappointing that while
      blockchain and Web3 are groundbreaking technologies, one of their most
      prominent use cases has become speculation at others' expense.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some argue that memecoins are similar to gambling - and with 24/7 markets,
      there are indeed parallels to online betting. However, when people gamble,
      they generally understand and accept the risks. With crypto, memecoins
      negatively impact the mainstream perception of the entire ecosystem.
      Unlike gambling, cryptocurrency technology can enable near-instant
      cross-border transactions, eliminate intermediaries, and leverage
      cryptography for security. Memecoins represent pure greed amplified by
      software, undermining the revolutionary potential of blockchain
      technology. Not to mention the obvious problems like snipers, rug pulls,
      and celebrities hyping up coins only to dump them on their fans. At the
      end of the day, crypto is just software - it is neither inherently good
      nor bad. Code has no feelings; it is the people who wield this technology
      that determine whether its impact is positive or negative.
