    <div class="app-intro">
        <p>My University club would sell discount cards to our club members. It allowed them to get
             discounts at the onboarded restaurants. It was a great business model, but the only issue was 
             that since they were paper cards, we could not collect data about them. We didn't know how often the cards were being used, how much money we were saving 
             the members, etc.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By turning it into a mobile app, everything could be tracked in one centralized place. We were able to make 
            data-driven decisions, create case studies about restaurant successes with our club, and gain more leverage when onboarding new restaurants.</p>
