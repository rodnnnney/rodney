    <div class="app-intro">
        <p>This past summer when I was in Toronto, I had a friend tell me about the Cansbridge Fellowship, they give you a 10k scholarship and make you get an internship overseas whilst getting to meet other super cool people. I was intruiged and attended an info-session at my school when they came.
            Fast forward, I got rejected from the fellowship but was offered to try for the scholars program. I got into that one and it has been one of the most impactful things I've done in my life. There, I met some of my best friends, inspiring leaders, and overall some of the coolest people
            I've ever met in my life. Each pursuing their own goals but united in the desire to escape mediocrity
        </p>

        <p>Here are some of my main takeaways:</p>

        <p><b>Community really matters</b>, before joining cansbridge scholars, I didn't know that many people that wanted to build cool stuff, do startups and be ambitious. I whole heartedly believe that the people you surround yourself with is so important. 
            When you see other people around you working hard and wanting to accomplish more, it automatically makes you want to do the same. Its hard to describe what its like so I encourage you to seek out this feeling. Find people that you think are cool, are doing cool thing 
            and hang around them for a while. I promise you that after a while, you end up more like them. For the better or for worse
        </p>

        <p><b>Don't ask don't get</b>, at first I thought this saying was super corny and cringe. However after I implemented it when I did cold outreach to potential partners and sponsors for my blockchain club, I noticed how powerful it really is. 
            Doing cold outreach can seem cringe or daunting but it shows you have initiative. If you have a goal. nobody else cares more about it than you
        </p>

        <p><b>Make it happen</b>, if you want it bad enough, you will make it happen </p>

        <p>Special shoutouts to Lyn and Conrad, for believing in me when I didn't even believe in myself</p>
