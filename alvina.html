    <p>Hi Alvina</p>
    <p>Surreal</p>
    <p>
      It has been exactly a month since I've asked you be my girlfriend and
      every single day passing that has felt surreal. Not a day goes on without
      me thinking about how cool you are and how fortunate I am to have met
      someone like you :) It has been officially 18 days since I've seen you and
      it will be another 5 before we reunite.I still remember spending our first
      Valentines together. Never did I think I would be making web apps for the
      girl I had a crush on but guess you make want to do corny things.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond the degeneracy and hornyness I display, I really am a impressed and
      in awe with you. You are so pretty for actually no reason. From you hallow
      cheek bones, your eyebrows and lashes, you cute nose. How your tattoos
      flow seamlessly on your pale soft skin, the warmth of your plump lips (I
      miss sm). I can safely say you are the prettiest girl I've laid eyes upon.
      Beyond just surface level looks, you are ambitious and outgoing. You're
      working full time, leading projects at UTMIST, doing ai research (all
      while responding to my texts in seconds :D). I can really talk to you
      about anything, computer science, philosophy, startups, and anything else
      I think is cool. The fact that you have morals and standards make an even
      more appealing woman.
    </p>

    <p>
      I understand that this is a early on in our relationship, something new,
      something exciting. I also know that this feeling cannot last forever, we
      have yet encounter our first real test as bf/gf, I pray that when we do,
      we stay patient, understanding, empathetic with each other. I understand
      being with someone also implies that you must accept areas that you might
      no agree with. (your vaping + sleep habits + eating habitsðŸ˜’) But I think
      if both parties are willing to have their minds changed, it won't be hard
      to truly "fix" someone. Call me naive, foolish or even autistic but in my
      religion, it is possible to change as person. I also believe that setting
      up some very basic systems will enable smoother communication. Combined
      with the fact that I hope our relationship can be a place in which we are
      vulnerable. I know you probably hate being vulnerable but I hope I am one
      of the very people that will see you like that. I want to lead by example
      with this since I am the one proposing these systems but there really
      hasn't been a case where I have felt the need. You've been perfect up to
      date. You can perceive vulnerability either as weakness or empowerment,
      I'd argue for the latter.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know distance is hard(and it inflates the number of days we've been
      dating tenfold) but in a way, you can view it as a test of whether you
      truly like the other person of not. Are they all you can think of when
      before you go to sleep? first thing when you wake up? btw you are - Alvina
      Yang. It makes it when I do get to see you such better(supply and demand!!
      yes we love economics and how the invisible hand of the market guides
      everything ahha).
    </p>

    <p>
      I dont want to stroke you ego too hard so I'll end it here but I want to
      drive the point home of how much you inspire me, how much you make me want
      to improve myself how proud I am to be your friend, your boyfriend, your
      hackathon buddy and a part of your crazy life.
    </p>

    <p><strike>Love</strike> Like,</p>
    Rodney
