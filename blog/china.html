    <p>
      I will preface by saying that this essay is comprised of my own
      observations.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="quote-block">
      <p>
        <b>All oranges are my own</b> or whatever people say before making some
        controversial claims and don't want to get fired if their employer sees

    <h3>TLDR</h3>

    <ul>
      <i>
        <p>Canada and West have lots of talent but not lots of scale</p>
      </i>
      <i>China has lots of scale but not that much innovation talent </i>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I recently visited China, my country of birth. During my time there, I
      spoke with many friends working in ai startups and tech. Through these
      conversations, I noticed significant differences between how the East and
      West approach innovation in the technology sector. Keep in mind this is a
      very small sample size and reflective of the civilization as a whole.
      However, I observed several approaches that could potentially strengthen
      Canada's innovation ecosystem and economic growth if implemented
      thoughtfully with a Canadian touch (eh).
    </p>

    <p>
      Before I discuss these differences, I want to give a rough history
      overview of China because I believe that gives significant context as to
      why people behave the way they do. Chinese civilization has been around
      for more than 5,000 years but the labors of our ancestors could not be
      reaped by subsequent generations. China has been destroyed over and over
      again, nothing seemed to stick. From the devastating Opium Wars of the
      19th century, to the brutal Japanese invasion during World War II that
      claimed millions of lives, to the tumultuous Cultural Revolution - China
      has endured numerous conflicts and internal struggles that have repeatedly
      disrupted progress. These historical wounds remain in collective memory,
      yet they also serve as mental models and spiritual guidance to the people
      of China that they can do amazing things despite adversity.
    </p>

    <p>
      To continue on this point that China is a startup, only recently have the
      efforts seem to have compounded and deliver on tangible results. With
      recent breakthroughs in AI such as Deepseek and Qwen combined with
      innovation in the robotics and drone sector with companies like DJI, I
      started to ask myself what was at the root of this innovation?
    </p>

    <h3>China as a emerging first world country</h3>
    <p>
      When you compare GDP per capita numbers of China($12,614) versus
      Canada($55,522) or USA($82,769), you can see the massive gap, a multiple
      of 5-8. It also doesn't make sense when you visit and observe the
      architectural masterpieces and public transportation that is cheap, clean,
      and consistency on time. To contrast this, in the city where I live -
      Ottawa, Canada, public transportation is a nightmare and driving seems to
      be the only means of viable transportation. I think you can attribute this
      to a few things, China's population is ~36 larger, and you can make the
      plausible argument that China simply has a substantial larger labour pool
      to fill these roles. Okay - fair enough. I believe this also forces China
      to attempt wild things in hopes of bridging the gap. This is like a
      startup trying to compete with Google, not in a gazillion years will they
      be able to catch up and compete by traditional means. Therefore they must
      adopt and innovate on drastically abnormal and frankly insane strategies.
      On a larger scale, this analogy can be applied to China and the West.
    </p>

    <h4>Collectivism and Individualism</h4>
    <p>
      Another large difference I've observed is in the education system. I
      remember when I went to see family, I couldn't see my nephew until 9pm
      every weekday. The reason was because he was at school until then. When I
      start to think my computer science courses are a grind, I reflect that my
      14-year-old nephew has to go to school for 12 hours a day, learning 8
      different subjects. I think I have it a lot easier in comparison.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, my friend argued that come post-secondary, the edge Chinese
      students received from grinding 12 hours for all of elementary school and
      high school wasn't that substantial. Most of the time, western
      post-secondary school students drove innovation better than their Chinese
      counterparts. You can see startups created by university students go on to
      raise millions and achieve meaningful levels of success, combined with the
      popularity of accelerator programs whose sole purpose is to help founders
      achieve their goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mental model Chinese students have is that they go to school to become
      contributing members of society. They usually put aside their personal
      pursuits in order to please family or society. In the west, I've observed
      a striking juxtaposition - students have the freedom to pursue education
      aligned with their individual passions and interests, often regardless of
      the direct societal impact. This emphasis on personal fulfillment rather
      than collective contribution creates a different innovation landscape with
      its own strengths and weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      A weakness of this collectivism mindset, in my opinion, is that it can
      inhibit innovation, creativity, and discourage entrepreneurship. I
      couldn't find an exact stat for this, but you can observe the culture of
      top western institutions like Stanford, which are known for producing tech
      founders. On the flip side, a flaw I've observed with individualism is the
      lack of urgency. With individualism, you can see students pursuing some
      arguably impractical degrees (perhaps I'm biased due to my STEM
      background), as well as the traditional flaws of individualism such as
      general selfishness and a reduced sense of obligation to contribute to
      society or attempt to solve society's biggest problems. However, I believe
      this phenomenon isn't exclusive to countries. I'll give another startup
      analogy because I love startups. Imagine China was a startup and Canada
      was like a bloated big tech company. In China's case, you cannot afford to
      have employees that are concerned with anything less than the mission of
      the company. Every action, every all nighter is in hopes that the startup
      does well. This collectivism mindset is very real, I've observed this in
      my personal experiences working at startups as well as anecdotes to my
      friends. Contrasted to a big tech company, imagine you are working some
      internal tool to help test and automate internal tools, your existence
      honestly probably doesn't matter to the organization. I argue that this
      then leads to individualism because caring is 2 way street. If the
      organization doesn't value your contribution significantly, you're more
      likely to prioritize your own interests, work-life balance, and personal
      development over organizational goals. Individualism
    </p>

    <h4>The impact</h4>
    <p>
      If you believe that students are the main drivers of innovation, these
      contrasting approaches create different innovation ecosystems. The
      collectivist approach can mobilize resources and talent toward national
      priorities with remarkable efficiency, producing concentrated progress in
      strategic sectors. Meanwhile, the individualist approach tends to generate
      more diverse and unexpected innovations, often creating entirely new
      markets rather than optimizing existing ones.
    </p>

    <h3>0-1 and 1-100</h3>
    <p>
      0-1, a term coined by renowned founder, venture capitalist Peter Thiel.
      The notion describes:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="quote-block">
      <p>
        creating something new and original, rather than just improving on what
        already exists.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Like many, I believe that this is where the West's edge exist. Building
      something from nothing and creative requires thinking outside the box,
      something individualism is much more suited to do rather than
      collectivism. To spark innovation, you need people that are quite frankly
      not normal. You can see that the West have pioneered transformers,
      transistors, automobiles, trains, and planes, just to name a few.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the flip, China's collectivist mindset allows them excel 1-100. Once a
      mvp is created that is proved to work, they are quick to copy and improve
      at. Something recent was Deepseek R1 that came out of a small AI lab in
      Guangzhou. I'm sure you guys have heard on it news but its essentially
      comparable if not better than ChatGPTs O1 at a fraction of the cost.
      China's strength in automation and mass production is evident in how
      they've revolutionized manufacturing processes, turning innovative
      concepts into scalable realities at unprecedented speeds and costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Basically, Canada and the west would be better with more automation and
      scale to extend the ideas of homegrown geniuses and China can do better
      with more innovation talent. Encouraging those that think about the box
      and not be quantized 100% based off test-taking abilities.
